            <h3>Why a Balanced Diet Matters</h3>
             <p>
                Eating well plays a role in keeping us healthy and feeling good. A balanced diet helps our body get the right mix of vitamins, carbs, minerals, proteins and fats it needs to work at its best. What we eat directly impacts how much energy we have and how clearly we think, because food provides the fuel and raw materials our body depends on every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, when it comes to children, teenagers, and pregnant women, getting the right nutrition is especially for healthy growth, development, and reproduction. Key nutrients such as calcium, iron, and folic acid play a crucial role in supporting strong bones and the proper development of the fetus.
            </p>
            <p>
                A balanced diet helps maintain high energy levels throughout the day. It also helps reduce the risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and certain types of cancer. It helps regulate cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure, which are key factors in disease prevention.
            </p>

            <h4>General Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Drink at least 1.5–2 liters of water daily</li>
                <li>Include protein in every meal</li>
                <li>Avoid sugary foods, sodas, and ultra-processed snacks</li>
                <li>Adjust portions based on physical activity</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Perspectives from Our Interviews</h4>
            <p>We asked a few friends about their diets and routines. Here’s what they shared:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Giovanni:</strong> Maintains good physical condition despite a relaxed diet of pasta, pizza, and occasional proteins. His active lifestyle and possibly fast metabolism may be helping him maintain balance, even without a strict diet plan.</li>
                <li><strong>Alice:</strong> Eats healthily and exercises consistently, yet is not seeing the results she hopes for. Possible factors include caloric intake, recovery issues, or a training plan not aligned with her specific fitness goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Marco:</strong> Relies on home-cooked meals without following a fixed dietary plan, but stays fit thanks to his daily training. His case suggests that regular exercise can sometimes make up for less-structured diet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Current Trends in Italy</h4>
            <p>A recent survey of 89,321 teens revealed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Only 7.5% exercise daily, 13.8% never do</li>
                <li>26.5% of 17-year-olds spend over 5 hours/day on social media</li>
                <li>26.8% skip breakfast, 12% eat sweets daily</li>
                <li>Low fruit/veg intake: 6% never eat fruit, 7.4% never eat vegetables</li>
                <li>Excess fats and sugars: consumed 2–4 times a week by 29.4%, and daily by 26.2%</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>A Global Perspective</h4>
            <p>WHO/Europe highlights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Less than 40% of teenagers eat fruits or vegetables daily, and the numbers drop with age</li>
                <li>25% of youths consume sweets every day, with rates higher among girls</li>
                <li>15% drink sugary soft drinks daily, especially among those from lower-income families</li>
                <li>Physical inactivity remains a concern, with many adolescents not meeting the recommended levels of daily physical activity</li>
            </ul>
